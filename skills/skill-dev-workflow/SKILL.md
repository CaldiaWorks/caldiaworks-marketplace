# Skill Development Workflow

Orchestrate the full lifecycle of creating a skill for the CaldiaWorks marketplace. This skill is specific to the CaldiaWorks Skills repository.

## Mandatory Execution Rule

Each invoked skill defines its own internal steps. **Every internal step of every invoked skill must be executed in order without exception.** Do not skip, merge, or silently omit any step -- even if the step seems trivial or the answer seems obvious.

If a step requires user input or confirmation, ask. If a step produces output, present it. Violating this rule degrades quality and erodes user trust.

## Partial Workflow Entry

If the user already has artifacts from earlier steps, skip completed steps:

| Existing Artifact | Start From |
|-------------------|------------|
| Idea document | Step 2: Issue Creation |
| Issue number | Step 3: Planning |
| Plan document | Step 4: Branch Creation |
| USDM requirements document | Step 6: Skill Implementation |

Ask the user what artifacts they already have before starting.

## Workflow Steps

Execute these 9 steps in order. After each step completes, ask the user whether to proceed to the next step.

### Step 1: Ideation

Invoke the `ideation` skill.

- Input: User's rough idea or problem description
- Output: Idea document at `.docs/ideas/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
- Pass the idea document path to Step 5 (USDM)

### Step 2: Issue Creation (Parent Issue)

Invoke the `issue-create` skill in standalone mode.

- Input: Summary from the idea document
- Output: GitHub Issue number and URL
- Pass the issue number to Step 3 (Planning)

### Step 3: Planning

Invoke the `planning` skill.

- Input: The parent issue number from Step 2
- Output: Plan document at `.docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
- Pass the plan document and first work unit's issue numbers to Step 4

Update the plan document: set the first work unit's Status to `In Progress`.

### Step 4: Branch Creation

Invoke the `branch-create` skill.

- Input: Issue number and description from the plan's first work unit
- Output: Feature branch name

Update the plan document: set the work unit's Branch to the created branch name.

### Step 5: Requirements Definition (USDM)

Invoke the `usdm` skill.

- Input: The idea document from Step 1
- Output: USDM requirements document at `.docs/REQ-DOC-*.md`

After USDM completes, invoke the `issue-create` skill in USDM mode to create requirement sub-issues:
- Input: USDM document path + parent issue number from Step 2
- This creates all REQ issues as sub-issues with SPECs in the body

### Step 6: Skill Implementation

Invoke the `skill-creator` skill.

- Input: The USDM requirements document from Step 5
- Output: Complete skill directory under `skills/<skill-name>/`
- The skill must include `SKILL.md` with frontmatter

After `skill-creator` completes:
1. Add the skill path to both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
2. Bump the version in both manifest files to the same value.

### Step 7: Commit

Invoke the `commit` skill.

- Input: All changes from Steps 4-6
- Commits may be made multiple times during implementation for safety

### Step 8: Pull Request

Invoke the `pull-request` skill.

- Input: The feature branch with all commits
- Output: PR number and URL

After the PR is merged or the user confirms completion, update the plan document: set the work unit's Status to `Done`.

### Step 9: Issue Cleanup

After the PR is merged, close all remaining open sub-issues under the parent issue.

1. List open sub-issues of the parent issue: `gh sub-issue list <parent-issue-number>`
2. For each open sub-issue, recursively list and close its own sub-issues first (bottom-up).
3. Close each open sub-issue with a comment referencing the merged PR.

This is necessary because `Resolves #N` in commit messages only auto-closes the directly referenced issues. Sub-issues created from USDM requirements (sub-REQs) are not auto-closed and must be closed explicitly.

## Plan Progress Tracking

Throughout the workflow, keep the plan document up to date:

| Event | Update |
|-------|--------|
| Work unit begins | Status: `Pending` -> `In Progress` |
| Branch created | Branch: `TBD` -> branch name |
| PR merged or user confirms completion | Status: `In Progress` -> `Done` |

## Before Finishing

After the workflow completes (or when the user stops at any step), verify nothing is left behind:

- **Open issues?** Are there sub-issues under the parent issue that should be closed? Step 9 handles this after merge, but if the workflow is interrupted earlier, flag any open issues to the user.
- **Uncommitted changes?** Run `git status` to check for changes that were not included in the final commit.
- **Plan up to date?** Does the plan document reflect the actual state of all work units (Status and Branch columns)?

## Constraints

- This skill is specific to the CaldiaWorks Skills repository.
- Always follow the project's git workflow: feature branches, squash merge, no direct commits to main.
- Do not skip marketplace registration after skill creation.
