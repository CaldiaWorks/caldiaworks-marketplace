# GitHub Issue Creation

Create GitHub Issues in two modes: standalone (interactive) or USDM (batch from requirements document). Works in any Git repository with GitHub as the remote.

## Prerequisites

Before creating issues, verify the environment:

1. The current directory is a Git repository. If not, inform the user and stop.
2. The GitHub CLI (`gh`) is authenticated. If not, instruct the user to run `gh auth login`.

## Mode 1: Standalone Issue

Create a single issue through dialogue with the user.

### Step 1: Collect Details

1. Ask the user for an issue title (required).
2. Accept an optional issue body describing the issue in detail.
3. Accept optional labels for the issue.

If the user provides all details upfront (e.g., "create an issue titled X about Y"), skip the interactive prompts and proceed to confirmation.

### Step 2: Confirm and Create

1. Present the issue details (title, body, labels) for user confirmation.
2. On confirmation, create the issue:
   ```bash
   gh issue create --title "<title>" --label "<labels>" --body "<body>"
   ```
3. Display the created issue number and URL.

### Error Handling

If issue creation fails, display the error message returned by `gh issue create`.

## Mode 2: USDM Document Input

Create a hierarchy of issues from a USDM requirements document. This mode is triggered when the user provides a USDM document path and a parent issue number.

### Input

- **USDM document path**: Path to a Markdown file following USDM format (REQ/SPEC hierarchy).
- **Parent issue number**: The GitHub Issue under which top-level requirements are created as sub-issues.

### Step 1: Parse Requirements

1. Read the USDM document.
2. Extract all requirements (both top-level `REQ-NNN` and sub-requirements `REQ-NNN-N`).
3. For each requirement, collect:
   - ID and title
   - Reason
   - Description
   - Child specifications (SPEC) belonging to that requirement
   - Parent requirement (if it is a sub-requirement)
4. Present a summary of extracted requirements to the user for confirmation.

### Step 2: Create Issues Top-Down

Process the hierarchy top-down (parents before children) because `gh sub-issue add` requires the parent issue number.

For each requirement:

1. Create a GitHub Issue with label `usdm:req`.
2. The issue title follows the convention: `REQ-NNN: Title` or `REQ-NNN-N: Title`.
3. The issue body uses this template:

```markdown
## Reason

{Reason text from USDM document}

## Description

{Description text from USDM document}

## Specifications

| SPEC ID | Specification |
|---------|--------------|
| SPEC-NNN | {Specification text} |

## Source

- Document: [{document-id}]({link-to-document}) § {REQ-ID}
- Ticket: #{parent-issue-number}
```

4. Link the issue as a sub-issue:
   - Top-level REQs become sub-issues of the parent issue.
   - Sub-requirements become sub-issues of their parent requirement's issue.

```bash
gh issue create --title "REQ-001: Title" --label "usdm:req" --body "..."
gh sub-issue add <parent-issue-number> <new-issue-number>
```

5. Display the created issue number and URL after each creation.

### Step 3: Verify Hierarchy

After all issues are created, verify the hierarchy with `gh sub-issue list` on the parent issue and report the result to the user.

### Important Rules

- **Do not create separate issues for specifications (SPEC)**. Specifications are included in the parent requirement's issue body as a table.
- **Create `usdm:req` label** if it does not exist: `gh label create "usdm:req" --color 0075ca --description "USDM Requirement"`
- **Each issue is self-contained**: readable and understandable on its own, with a source reference link back to the USDM document.
- **Process top-down**: always create parent issues before children.

See `references/usdm-issue-mapping.md` for the full mapping guide.

## Constraints

- Do not create issues outside the current repository.
- Do not modify existing issues unless explicitly part of the USDM hierarchy creation.
- Always confirm with the user before creating issues (in standalone mode) or before starting batch creation (in USDM mode).
